We provide three example projects in C++ and two in Python to help you get started:

------------

## Blank App Template
This is a template using C++ for Windows and macOS which is just a blank application with a custom UI collection with a single button setup for you. It's convenient to use as a starting point for your own applications - you can just make a copy of it and start creating.

## Simple Window
This example builds on the previous one and shows how to create custom window objects and custom UI element objects. It also shows how to handle custom actions, key presses, and other events from the application.

## Elements Catalog
This example is a comprehensive catalog of every built-in UI element that is available to you. It's convenient to be aware of the tools you have, and is useful for seeing how the elements are specified in the real-world use scenario. It's also useful since you can quickly copy-paste desired elements into your own code.
